# CashTracker Web Application
### Abbey Allen & Clark Farnsworth

## General Overview
Our project is an expense tracker called "CashTrack". It allows users to create an account and log in, add, view, edit, and delete receipts. They can also be shown a map of nearby stores
based on their location. The app will be built using Firebase and React as well as a Geolocation API
## Technical Challenges
One of the technical challenges we anticipate is implementing the geolocation API as well as working with Firebase since it is new to both partners.
## Requirements
Cash Track meets the requirements for the project by using Firebase Auth, Firebase Firestore and Google Maps. It will also be hosted using Firebase and github pages. We will also be using
a geolocation API for our Google Maps feature.
